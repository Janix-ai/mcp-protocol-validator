# MCP Protocol Validator Plan

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented most of the core components planned for the MCP Protocol Validator:

✅ Core Framework
- Transport layer with adapters for HTTP, STDIO, and Docker
- Protocol version support for 2024-11-05 and 2025-03-26
- Test organization by feature categories

✅ Test Suite
- Base protocol tests (initialization, shutdown)
- Tool-related tests (listing, calling)
- Resource management tests
- Prompt completion tests
- Utilities (batch requests, error handling)

✅ Reference Implementation

- Create Docker containers for easy deployment
- Publish packages for easy installation

### 4. Future Enhancements
- Support for additional protocol versions
- Enhanced reporting features
- Performance testing module
- Test suite for custom tool implementations

## Timeline
- Testing & Validation: 1 week
- Documentation Enhancement: 1 week

## Objective
Create a unified testing framework for MCP servers that:
- Supports both STDIO and HTTP transport protocols
- Tests multiple protocol versions
- Provides comprehensive test coverage for all protocol features
- Has clear, consistent test organization
- Enables easy configuration and execution

## Current Challenges
- Inconsistent handling of multiple transport protocols (HTTP/STDIO)
- Overlapping test scripts with duplicate functionality
- Lack of clear organization for protocol version testing
- Incomplete test coverage for protocol features
- Confusing setup process for testing different servers

## Solution Architecture
### Unified Transport Layer
- Abstract MCP transport to support both STDIO and HTTP
- Handle protocol-specific details in dedicated adapter classes
- Provide a consistent interface for test cases

### Protocol Version Support
- Support multiple MCP protocol versions
- Version-specific test cases and expectations
- Clear comparison of differences between versions

### Test Framework Organization
- Structured test framework organized by feature categories
- Shared test base class with common functionality
- Skip logic for tests incompatible with certain protocol versions or transports

## Command Line Interface
```
./run_validator.py 
  --transport [http|stdio]
  --server-command [command to start server]
  --docker-image [image name]
  --protocol-version [version]
  --report [format]
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Refactoring (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Refactor test framework to support multiple transport types
- ✅ Create protocol version adapters
- ✅ Implement Docker-based test server reference implementations
- ✅ Add test skip logic for incompatible protocol/transport combinations
- ✅ Add pytest markers for protocol versions and transport types

### Phase 2: Test Module Organization (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Organize tests by protocol feature categories:
  - ✅ tools.py (tool listing and execution)
  - ✅ protocol_negotiation.py (version negotiation and capabilities)
  - ✅ resources.py (resource management)
  - ✅ prompts.py (prompt handling and completions)
  - ✅ utilities.py (batch requests, error handling, etc.)

### Phase 3: Documentation & Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Update protocol version comparison documentation
- ✅ Create user guide for validator
- ✅ Document legacy test scripts
- ✅ Create helper scripts for running tests

### Phase 4: Future Work (PLANNED)
- Integration with CI pipeline
- Full testing with reference implementations
- Support for additional protocol versions
- Enhanced reporting features
- Migration or removal of legacy test scripts

   - Tool calling with parameters
   - Error handling for invalid tool calls

3. **Resources**
   - Resource creation and management
   - Resource lifecycle
   - Error handling for invalid resource operations

4. **Prompts**
   - Basic prompt handling
   - Streaming responses
   - Context handling
