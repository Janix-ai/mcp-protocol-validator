# Simple Test Report

*Generated on 2025-04-07 at 11:21:05*

## Overview

This is a simple test report generated directly to verify file writing works
in the desired directory. This report was not generated by pytest but is
just a simple file to demonstrate that we can write to the specified directory.

## System Information

- Current working directory: /Users/scott/AI/PROTOCOL_STRATEGY/mcp/tools/mcp-protocol-validator
- Python version: 3.11.11 (main, Dec  3 2024, 17:20:40) [Clang 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.4)]
- Output directory: md_reports
- Report path: md_reports/test_report_20250407_112105.md

## Next Steps

Once we've verified that this report is successfully written, we can
focus on enhancing our test_stdio_server.py script to generate more
comprehensive reports in Markdown format directly, without relying on
the pytest-md plugin.
