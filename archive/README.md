### mcp-protocol-validator/

This is an older version of the MCP Protocol Validator framework that has been superseded by the more organized structure in the main repository. It's retained for historical reference only.

Key differences from the main repository:
- Different file organization and structure
- Older versions of several core files (e.g., mcp_validator.py)
- Multiple test scripts in the root directory rather than organized modules
- Lacks the unified command-line interface (run_validator.py)

**Note:** These files should not be used for development or testing. Please use the current files in the main repository instead.
