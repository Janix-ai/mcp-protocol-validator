# Fixed Test Scripts for MCP Protocol Validator

We've made several improvements to the test scripts to reliably test the minimal_mcp_server:

## Issues Fixed

1. **Import Path Issues**: Fixed the import paths in `tests/test_base_protocol.py` by adding code to insert the parent directory into the Python path, ensuring imports work regardless of how the tests are run.

2. **Command-Line Argument Handling**: Updated `run_validator.py` to properly handle the `test` command and to gracefully handle default values when no explicit command is provided.

3. **Configuration Parsing**: Fixed `utils/config.py` to handle cases where command-line arguments might be missing, avoiding attribute errors.

4. **STDIOTransport Initialization**: Updated the STDIOTransport usage in `tests/test_base.py` to match the correct interface from `transport/stdio_client.py`, using the correct parameter names.

## Created a Direct Test Script

We created a standalone test script (`test_minimal_server_direct.py`) that directly uses the STDIOTransport to test the minimal_mcp_server without relying on the full test framework. This script:

1. Initializes a connection to the server
2. Tests the basic protocol methods (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)
3. Tests resources (for protocol version 2025-03-26)
4. Properly shuts down the server

The direct test script successfully tests both the 2024-11-05 and 2025-03-26 protocol versions.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling in the test framework, especially for subprocess management.

2. **Better Documentation**: Update documentation to clearly explain the correct command-line format for running tests.

3. **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests can be run in isolation without relying on the full test framework.

4. **Simplified Test Execution**: Consider providing simpler scripts for common test scenarios.

5. **Path Management**: Standardize the approach to managing Python paths to avoid import issues.

These changes should make the testing process more reliable and easier to understand.
